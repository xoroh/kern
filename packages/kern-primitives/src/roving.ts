/**
 * Roving index — one tab stop per group, arrow traversal within it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a primitive and not a component
 *
 * A composite control (a list of segments, a carousel's item track, a
 * time-picker's three fields) is ONE tab stop, not N. Inside it, arrow keys move
 * between items. That is "roving focus", and it is a model — an active index plus
 * the invariant that only the active item is in the tab order — not a widget.
 *
 * The mechanism is platform-specific and deliberately NOT here: web presses
 * ArrowLeft/ArrowRight; React Native has no arrow keys at all, because a touch
 * device has no keyboard. So the two renderers supply their own input handling
 * and this model supplies only the state and the derived per-item facts. Folding
 * key handling in would make the "platform-free" claim false, which is the same
 * mistake the SheetSurface extraction would have made.
 *
 * ## What callers get
 *
 * `describe(index)` returns `isActive` and `isTabbable`. Those are deliberately
 * NOT named `tabIndex` or `focused`: `tabIndex` is web vocabulary, and a native
 * renderer maps `isTabbable` onto `accessibilityState.selected` instead. The
 * model must not encode which platform is consuming it, or a future third
 * renderer has to work around the web one.
 *
 * ## Wrap and disabled
 *
 * `loop: true` wraps from last to first. `loop: false` stops, and the
 * corresponding `next()`/`previous()` at the end is a no-op that returns the
 * same index — callers that need to know can compare. Disabled items are
 * skipped by traversal but keep their own position, so `count` and the index
 * stable: skipping by deletion would renumber everything after it.

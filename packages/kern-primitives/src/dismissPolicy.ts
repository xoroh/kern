/**
 * The dismissal POLICY for a kern surface — what closes it, and whether a
 * visible close affordance must be rendered.
 *
 * ## Why this is a primitive
 *
 * P2c-2 §3 Wave 1: give behaviour that exists on BOTH renderers with
 * independent implementations one owner. Dismissal is that behaviour.
 *
 * The native `SheetSurface` already encodes the rule in one line, with a
 * comment recording the defect it fixed:
 *
 *     // a sheet that declares `dismissible` but renders no close control for it
 *     const showClose = dismissible ?? Boolean(onDismiss);
 *
 * The web `SheetSurface` encodes the same decision differently — the close
 * button is rendered when `onClose` is passed. Both are one rule wearing two
 * renderers, which is the `useControllableState` failure mode repeating: a fix
 * to one silently does not reach the other.
 *
 * ## What is genuinely shared, and what is not
 *
 * The POLICY is shared and belongs here: which triggers dismiss, and whether a
 * close affordance must exist. The TRIGGERS are not — a scrim `Pressable` and a
 * `Portal`/`Backdrop` are DOM, `onRequestClose` and hardware back are RN. So
 * this returns the decisions, and each renderer wires its own triggers to them.
 *
 * That split is what keeps it a primitive rather than contract data: a rule both
 * renderers must apply identically, with no platform type in sight.
